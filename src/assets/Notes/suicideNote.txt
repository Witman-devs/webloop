I am Dr. Juan Martinez, a doctor working under Redmarsh Healthcare.

Last week, a patient under my care passed away due to my ineptitude. 
His name was Marcus Thorne, he has a whole life ahead of him, but 
it was cut short because of me. 

What you see in front of you is a way for me to atone for what I 
have done, to pay for the years of life I have taken with my own. I 
hope the family of Marcus can forgive me for taking him away 
from them
