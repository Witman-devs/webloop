Molly,

You messed up! How could you be so sloppy with your work. I had to pay the Inspector to cover up your tracks, and frankly, I expected better from you. You killed a detectiveâ€™s daughter. Could you really not find anyone else for this work? Fortunately, the Inspector handled everything well and cleaned up the records, claiming there were no cameras. It was sheer luck that Dr. Cletus Blick happened to be passing by the road and was admitted to the hospital; otherwise that would have drawn far more attention.

Next time, be far more cautious. Keep the auction discreet. I will not tolerate anyone else buying what I want. This time James got his hands on the Item, which complicates things. I suspect a few people might become suspicious of our transactions, so we need to lie low for a while and let things cool.
