Respected Director Dr. Blick,

I am writing to you on behalf of the ward staff to express our  serious concerns about the current understaffing. The lack of adequate personnel is severely compromising the quality and safety of patient care and is leading to significant staff burnout. 
We kindly request that you address this issue.  

Sincerely,
Samuel Hayes
The Ward Staff
