Hey son,
Happy birthday!

I left a puzzle for you to solve on my computer, 
which keeps the computer locked for as long as the 
puzzle is unsolved. In other words, solve the puzzle 
to get access to the computer.

I will be out for a few days. Make sure that you do 
not use the computer for more than hour, but I can 
make a special exception since it's your birthday.

Enjoy your day!
