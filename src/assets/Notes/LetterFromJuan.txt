Urgent Concern Regarding Dr. Hubert Lowe's Conduct

Respected Director Dr. Blick,

I am writing to raise a serious concern about Dr. Hubert. Today, I saw him operating on a patient who, to my knowledge, was in a coma during my last check. Dr. Lowe claimed the patient had died this morning, but the medical records showed stable vitals.

This isn’t the first time I’ve seen him operating on deceased patients, often justifying it as "research with permission." Given the inconsistencies and lack of transparency, I fear this may point to something as grave as organ trafficking.

I urge you to investigate this matter discreetly and urgently.

Sincerely,
Dr. Juan Martinez
