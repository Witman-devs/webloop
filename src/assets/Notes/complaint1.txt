Respected Director Dr. Blick,

I am writing on behalf of the ward staff to address a significant issue with our internal communication systems. 

The current technology is outdated and unreliable, leading to frequent delays and miscommunications regarding patient updates, lab results, and critical care instructions. This not only causes unnecessary stress for the staff but also poses a direct risk to patient safety. We urgently request a review and upgrade of our communication infrastructure to ensure seamless and secure information flow.

Sincerely,
Samuel Hayes
The Ward Staff
