??? : So, how do you sleep at night ?
James: ** startled ** YOU!! What are you doing here at this hour? How did you get in ? 
??? : Don't ask those inconsequential questions to me. Just how many more did you kill ?
James: I don’t know what you are talking about. Why are you holding a knife! 
???: Don’t waste your energy on all of that. I very well know what you did at Redmarsh healthcare, I know the port incident, the inspector, and everyone involved in that. You're running this company on charades! 
James: Have you lost your mind!!? What are you talking about? For god sake we WORK together. 
** shouts for security **
???: Oh, they are all asleep and don’t you dare say that we worked on this together. I didn’t even know what you were up to you monster!
James: YOU MONSTER!! What did you do to them !? Did you KILL THEM ALL ? MY DAUGHTER! 
??? : Oh, I did not kill anyone for god's sake! I am not a killer like you who kills people for fun or money. You sold your goddamn soul for a few goddamn millions. I just knocked them out with sleeping gas. 
James: * trying to go towards the cupboard * See I don’t know what you want. I think you have mistaken me for someone else. 
???: I'm not here to kill you or anything, I just want answers from you.
James: YEAAA!! Right, says the guy holding a KNIFE in his hand. Puts my family and my guards to sleep. BREAKS INTO MY OFFICE AT MIDDLE OF NIGHT just to ask me questions while holding a knife! 
??? :  James.. James.. James… Don't act all cute with me! You killed so many, you killed my ROSE! I was right there on that day.. *incoherant*
James:  NO.. NO.. I didn’t do anything. 
??? : Oh yeah!? What about that painting right behind you? The Golden Mare! Don’t tell me you didn't buy it? You bought it for the millions of dollars, in return for the organs that you trafficked!
James: I just bought it, cause I have seen a recent surge in price in paintings, I thought I could also make some profit from it. 
???: Yeah sure! And I bought this knife because I thought metal is getting expensive and I could make some money out of it. You goddamn liar, I swear I'm gonna kill you some day. *incoherant* I saw the notes with your name all over it! 
James: Don’t be silly, Think about it. Why would I put my name in those notes, and whatever else you're talking about, that doesn't even make sense! I'm not that stupid. 
???: Either you are arrogant enough, or too smart, you knew the inspector will cover your ass whenever you make a mistake, same as what he did at the port for you!
* A little girl walks in *
Girl : Dad, Why is mom asleep ? I just got home, I wanted to show her what I made today :D
Girl : Why there is no light here dad?
* A gunshot * 
??? :  YOU DARE USE YOUR OWN DAUGHTER FOR DISTRACTION!!! 
* Another gunshot *
???: This is your last warning, Keep the gun down. I just need the answers and I still have a little bit of hope in you that you're not the killer. If you fire another shot on me then I'm pretty sure you're the one behind that.
* Another gunshot *
??? : GODDAMN, YOU LITTLE SHITHEAD. I knew you were the goddamn killer. You are not going to live another day!
*Knife wound sounds*
James: run away EMMMAAAA!!
